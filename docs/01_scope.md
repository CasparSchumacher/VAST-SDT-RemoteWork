# Step 2: Define Entry Point and Scope

## Entry Point

This project follows the **Narrative Theory Reconstruction (NTR)** approach, as the formalization builds directly on a verbal theoretical review rather than starting from a robust empirical phenomenon. The central theoretical framework is drawn from:

**Gagné, M., Parker, S. K., Griffin, M. A., De Cooman, R., & Magni, F. (2022).**  
*Understanding why, how, and when work design enables need satisfaction and motivation: A review and research agenda.*  
Journal of Applied Psychology, 107(4), 610–633. https://doi.org/10.1037/apl0000968

This article proposes a conceptual integration of Self-Determination Theory (SDT) with the changing realities of remote, hybrid, and algorithmically mediated work.

## Scope of Literature

Only the above article by Gagné et al. (2022) is used as the theoretical basis for this formalization. Although additional literature will be reviewed in parallel for later validation or simulation, the VAST formalization strictly reflects the structure and terminology of this single source.

---

## Phenomena to Be Explained

The model focuses on the following causal sequence:

**Remote work context → Satisfaction of psychological needs → Motivation → Job satisfaction**

The model does **not** attempt to cover additional downstream consequences such as turnover intentions, mental health, or performance metrics at this stage.

---

## Selected Constructs

The following constructs will be included in the VAST model:

- `REMOTE_WORK_CONTEXT`
- `NEED_SATISFACTION_AUTONOMY`
- `NEED_SATISFACTION_COMPETENCE`
- `NEED_SATISFACTION_RELATEDNESS`
- `INTRINSIC_MOTIVATION`
- `JOB_SATISFACTION`

These constructs will be defined in the upcoming Construct Source Table.

---

## Boundaries and Exclusions

The model explicitly excludes:
- Broader work design features not directly tied to remote work (e.g., task identity)
- Outcomes beyond attitudinal consequences (e.g., performance, health)
- Subtypes of motivation not explicitly mentioned in the Gagné paper

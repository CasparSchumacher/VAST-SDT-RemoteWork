# VAST-SDT-RemoteWork (short)
Formal VAST-based reconstruction of Self-Determination Theory in the context of remote work, based on Gagné et al. (2022). Following the modeling framework by Schönbrodt (2023).

# VAST-SDT-RemoteWork

This repository documents the step-by-step formalization of Self-Determination Theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 1985) in the context of remote and hybrid work, using the Visual Argument Structure Tool (VAST; Leising et al., 2023). The formalization follows the framework and checklist provided by Schönbrodt (2023): [FOMO-Psy VAST Guide](https://nicebread.github.io/FOMO-Psy/lectures/VAST/VAST_Intro.html).

The theoretical basis is derived primarily from Gagné et al. (2022), who propose a conceptual integration of SDT and evolving work contexts, particularly remote and hybrid work.

## Project Goals

- Reconstruct SDT in VAST format using literature on remote work (e.g., Gagné et al., 2022)
- Clarify core constructs and causal assumptions using transparent, modular diagrams
- Create simulation-ready variable and relationship tables based on theoretical assumptions
- Document the modeling process in an open, reproducible, and structured manner

## Project Structure

- `code/` – Simulation code for model evaluation
- `docs/` – Shared outputs and diagrams
- `tables/` – Construct Source Table, Variable Table, Relationship Table
- `final work/´ - final work in .qmd, .html and .pdf format 
- `README.md` – Project overview and setup instructions
- `CITATION.cff` – Citation file for referencing this project

The notation follows the formalization Steps and is ought to complement the final work.

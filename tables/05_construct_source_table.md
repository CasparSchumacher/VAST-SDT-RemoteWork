# Construct Source Table 

This table lists quotes from Gagné et al. (2022) that support the inclusion of each construct and relationship in the VAST model. Each quote is tagged by type (Phenomenon, Concept, or Relationship), labeled, and referenced. The table follows the formalization structure proposed by Schönbrodt (2023).

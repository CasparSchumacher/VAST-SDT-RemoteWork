# Construct Source Table 

This table lists atomic quotes from Gagné et al. (2022) that support the inclusion of each construct and relationship in the VAST model. Each quote is tagged by type (Phenomenon, Concept, or Relationship), labeled, and referenced. The table follows the formalization structure proposed by Schönbrodt (2023).

| ID | Type | Short name | Quote | Reference | rel. type | Comment | Incl. (Y/N) |
|----|------|------------|-------|-----------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| A1 | C | NEED_SATISFACTION_AUTONOMY | “that they are agents of their own behaviour as opposed to a ‘pawn’ of external pressures” | Gagné et al. (2022), p. 3 | – | Core SDT definition | Y |
| A2 | C | NEED_SATISFACTION_COMPETENCE | “people need to feel that they are effective and masters of their environment (need for competence)” | Gagné et al. (2022), p. 3 | – | Core SDT definition | Y |
| A3 | C | NEED_SATISFACTION_RELATEDNESS | “that they experience meaningful connections with other people (need for relatedness)” | Gagné et al. (2022), p. 3 | – | Core SDT definition | Y |
| A4 | C | INTRINSIC_MOTIVATION | “intrinsic motivation (doing something for its own sake, out of interest and enjoyment)” | Gagné et al. (2022), p. 3 | – | Core SDT motivation type | Y |
| A5 | R | AUTONOMY → MOTIVATION | “Satisfaction of the three psychological needs described above is significantly related to more self-determined motivation.” | Gagné et al. (2022), p. 7 | c | General SDT claim; modeled separately | Y |
| A6 | R | COMPETENCE → MOTIVATION | “Satisfaction of the three psychological needs described above is significantly related to more self-determined motivation.” | Gagné et al. (2022), p. 7 | c | Core SDT path | Y |
| A7 | R | RELATEDNESS → MOTIVATION | “Satisfaction of the three psychological needs described above is significantly related to more self-determined motivation.” | Gagné et al. (2022), p. 7 | c | Core SDT path | Y |
| A8 | C | CONTEXTUAL_COMPETENCE_THREATS | “The frustration of the need for competence can increase if individuals are constantly switching tasks to deal with overwhelming correspondence and failing to finish tasks in a timely manner.” | Gagné et al. (2022), p. 14 | – | Summarized as latent construct for work design failures | Y |
| A9 | R | REMOTE_WORK → COMPETENCE_THREATS | “Technology might thwart competence needs… constant electronic messages... individuals feel incompetent if it is not clear what information is most important… technology can malfunction, preventing workers from completing tasks.” | Gagné et al. (2022), p. 14 | c | Inferred link between remote work context and competence barriers | Y |
| A10 | C | SOCIAL_DISCONNECTION_RISK | “Remote workers can feel isolated from, and excluded by, colleagues [...] weakening their sense of belonging to a team or organization.” | Gagné et al. (2022), p. 15 | – | Basis for mediator between remote work and relatedness satisfaction | Y |
| A11 | R | REMOTE_WORK → SOCIAL_DISCONNECTION_RISK | “Remote workers can feel isolated from, and excluded by, colleagues [...] weakening their sense of belonging...” | Gagné et al. (2022), p. 15 | c | Justifies modeling `SOCIAL_DISCONNECTION_RISK` as a mediating construct | Y |
| A12 | C | HYBRID_WORK_CONTEXT | “Hybrid work seems to offer the best of both worlds, providing opportunities for connection and collaboration [...] and affording autonomy” | Gagné et al. (2022), p. 15 | – | Used as distinct input concept | Y |
| A13 | R | HYBRID_WORK → AUTONOMY | “Hybrid work seems to offer the best of both worlds, providing [...] autonomy in terms of flexible working.” | Gagné et al. (2022), p. 15 | c | Modeled as direct positive causal influence | Y |
| A14 | R | INTRINSIC_MOTIVATION → JOB_SATISFACTION | “More self-determined [...] motivation is more positively associated with key attitudinal outcomes, such as job satisfaction.” | Gagné et al. (2022), p. 7 | r | Reasoning link to model attitudinal outcome; mechanism unspecified | Y |

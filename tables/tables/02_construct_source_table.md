# Construct Source Table

This table defines all theoretical constructs included in the VAST formalization of Self-Determination Theory in the context of remote work. Each construct is specified with a working definition, its theoretical origin, and relevant indicators or measurements. The structure follows Schönbrodt’s (2023) formal modeling guide and Leising et al.’s (2023) recommendations on precision, modularity, and transparency.

| Construct | Working Definition | Theoretical Source | Measurement / Indicators |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|

| NEED_SATISFACTION_AUTONOMY | The experience of being an agent of one’s own behaviour, acting out of volition and choice, rather than external control. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 3): “that they are agents of their own behaviour as opposed to a ‘pawn’ of external pressures”:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} | Work-related Basic Need Satisfaction Scale (Van den Broeck et al., 2016); BPNSFS |

| NEED_SATISFACTION_COMPETENCE | The feeling of being effective in producing desired outcomes and exercising one’s capacities at work. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 3): “people need to feel that they are effective and masters of their environment (need for competence)”:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} | BPNSFS; perceived effectiveness; task performance self-evaluation |

| NEED_SATISFACTION_RELATEDNESS | The sense of being meaningfully connected with others, feeling supported and part of a larger whole. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 3): “that they experience meaningful connections with other people (need for relatedness)”:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} | BPNSFS; social support scales; perceived team cohesion |

| INTRINSIC_MOTIVATION | Doing an activity for its own sake, out of interest and inherent satisfaction, without external rewards or pressure. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 3): “intrinsic motivation (doing something for its own sake, out of interest and enjoyment)”:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} | Multidimensional Work Motivation Scale (Gagné et al., 2015); intrinsic motivation subscale |

| JOB_SATISFACTION | A positive affective evaluation of one's job, typically including enjoyment, alignment, and perceived value in work. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 7): “positively associated with key attitudinal outcomes, such as job satisfaction”:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} | Standard job satisfaction scales (e.g., JDI, Brayfield-Rothe) |

| REMOTE_WORK_CONTEXT | A work arrangement in which employees perform their job duties from locations outside the traditional office, relying on digital communication tools to stay connected. It includes full-time telework, asynchronous remote setups, and virtual coordination. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 15): “Remote workers can feel isolated from, and excluded by, colleagues [...] weakening their sense of belonging to a team or organization”:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} | Remote work status (binary or percentage), number of remote days per week, access to digital tools |

| HYBRID_WORK_CONTEXT | A structured form of work combining both in-office and remote components, designed to balance autonomy with social connection and collaboration. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 15): “Hybrid work seems to offer the best of both worlds, providing opportunities for connection and collaboration [...] and affording autonomy”:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} | Work schedule, number of in-office vs. remote days, self-reported work mode |

| CONTEXTUAL_COMPETENCE_THREATS | A latent construct summarizing contextual features of remote work that may inhibit feelings of competence. Includes technology malfunctions, overwhelming messaging, unclear expectations, and fragmented work. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 14): “Frustration of the need for competence can increase if individuals are constantly switching tasks [...] or failing to finish tasks in a timely manner”:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} | Tech disruption reports, role clarity, perceived overload, multitasking demands |

| SOCIAL_DISCONNECTION_RISK | A latent construct summarizing the potential for social and professional isolation under remote work. It reflects low informal contact, weak virtual team presence, and insufficient peer interaction. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 15): “Remote workers can feel isolated from, and excluded by, colleagues [...] weakening their sense of belonging”:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} | Team cohesion ratings, virtual interaction frequency, social support surveys |

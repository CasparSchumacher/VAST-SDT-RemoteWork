# Construct Source Table

This table defines all constructs in the VAST model, including working definitions, theoretical sources, and suggested indicators. The formatting ensures proper rendering on GitHub and follows VAST modeling standards (Schönbrodt, 2023; Leising et al., 2023).

| Construct | Working Definition | Theoretical Source | Measurement / Indicators |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| NEED_SATISFACTION_AUTONOMY | The experience of being an agent of one’s own behaviour, acting out of volition and choice, rather than external control. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 3): "that they are agents of their own behaviour as opposed to a ‘pawn’ of external pressures" | Work-related Basic Need Satisfaction Scale (Van den Broeck et al., 2016); BPNSFS |
| NEED_SATISFACTION_COMPETENCE | The feeling of being effective in producing desired outcomes and exercising one’s capacities at work. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 3): "people need to feel that they are effective and masters of their environment (need for competence)" | BPNSFS; perceived effectiveness; task performance self-evaluation |
| NEED_SATISFACTION_RELATEDNESS | The sense of being meaningfully connected with others, feeling supported and part of a larger whole. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 3): "that they experience meaningful connections with other people (need for relatedness)" | BPNSFS; social support scales; perceived team cohesion |
| INTRINSIC_MOTIVATION | Doing an activity for its own sake, out of interest and inherent satisfaction, without external rewards or pressure. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 3): "intrinsic motivation (doing something for its own sake, out of interest and enjoyment)" | Multidimensional Work Motivation Scale (Gagné et al., 2015); intrinsic motivation subscale |
| JOB_SATISFACTION | A positive affective evaluation of one's job, typically including enjoyment, alignment, and perceived value in work. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 7): "positively associated with key attitudinal outcomes, such as job satisfaction" | Job Descriptive Index (JDI); Brayfield-Rothe scale; single-item global satisfaction |
| REMOTE_WORK_CONTEXT | A work arrangement in which employees perform their job duties from locations outside the traditional office, relying on digital communication tools. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 15): "Remote workers can feel isolated from, and excluded by, colleagues [...] weakening their sense of belonging" | Remote work status (binary or %), remote days per week, digital communication frequency |
| HYBRID_WORK_CONTEXT | A structured work mode that combines remote and in-office elements to balance autonomy and collaboration. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 15): "Hybrid work seems to offer the best of both worlds, providing opportunities for connection and collaboration [...] and affording autonomy" | Days worked on-site vs. remotely, flexibility ratings, work mode classification |
| CONTEXTUAL_COMPETENCE_THREATS | A latent construct summarizing contextual features of remote work that may undermine competence, such as communication overload, task fragmentation, or tech failures. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 14): "Frustration of the need for competence can increase if individuals are constantly switching tasks [...] or failing to finish tasks in a timely manner" | ICT burden, ambiguity in roles, multitasking demands, tech reliability issues |
| SOCIAL_DISCONNECTION_RISK | A latent construct reflecting the potential for social isolation under remote work, characterized by low informal contact and weak team cohesion. | Gagné et al. (2022, p. 15): "Remote workers can feel isolated from, and excluded by, colleagues [...] weakening their sense of belonging" | Virtual interaction frequency, team cohesion index, social support self-reports |

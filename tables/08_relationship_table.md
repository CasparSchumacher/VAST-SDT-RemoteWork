# Relationship Table

This table defines all relationships between constructs in the VAST model. Each relation is classified by type (causal `c`, probabilistic `p`, or reasoning `r`), strength, and supporting words/phrases from Gagné et al. (2022). Moderators are noted where applicable.

| From | To | Type (strength) | Key words (strength indicator) | Moderator | Comment |
|-----|----|-----------------|--------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| REMOTE_WORK_CONTEXT | CONTEXTUAL_COMPETENCE_CONDITIONS | c (weak) | might thwart | – | Remote work can introduce competence barriers under poor conditions |
| REMOTE_WORK_CONTEXT | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_CONDITIONS | c (moderate) | can present | – | Remote work can challenge relatedness if not well-structured |
| REMOTE_WORK_CONTEXT | AUTONOMY_SUPPORT | r (moderate) | important to | – | Theoretical recommendation for autonomy-supportive design |
| HYBRID_WORK_CONTEXT | NEED_SATISFACTION_AUTONOMY | c (moderate) | seems to offer | – | Hybrid work can promote autonomy if well designed |
| HYBRID_WORK_CONTEXT | NEED_SATISFACTION_RELATEDNESS | c (moderate) | seems to offer | – | Hybrid work can promote relatedness if well structured |
| AUTONOMY_SUPPORT | NEED_SATISFACTION_AUTONOMY | c (strong) | leads to | Emotional Stability (moderator) | Autonomy-supportive management increases autonomy satisfaction |
| CONTEXTUAL_COMPETENCE_CONDITIONS | NEED_SATISFACTION_COMPETENCE | c (weak) | might thwart | – | Competence conditions influence competence satisfaction |
| SOCIAL_CONNECTION_CONDITIONS | NEED_SATISFACTION_RELATEDNESS | c (strong) | lead to | – | Social connection conditions influence relatedness satisfaction |
| NEED_SATISFACTION_AUTONOMY | INTRINSIC_MOTIVATION | c (strong) | significantly related to | – | Core SDT causal link |

# Variable Table

This table defines each construct from the VAST display as a simulation-ready variable. It specifies the scale type (following Stevens, 1946), numeric range, and semantic anchors. Decisions follow Schönbrodt’s (2023) formalization guide and reflect both the verbal theory in Gagné et al. (2022) and established SDT measurement practices.

| Construct in VAST display | Shortname | Type | Range/Values | Anchors |
|---------------------------|-----------|------|---------------|---------|
| NEED_SATISFACTION_AUTONOMY | autonomy | Interval | [0; 1] | 0 = fully controlled; 1 = fully autonomous |
| NEED_SATISFACTION_COMPETENCE | competence | Interval | [0; 1] | 0 = ineffective; 1 = competent/mastery |
| NEED_SATISFACTION_RELATEDNESS | relatedness | Interval | [0; 1] | 0 = socially isolated; 1 = connected/belonging |
| AUTONOMY_SUPPORT | auto_support | Interval | [0; 1] | 0 = highly controlling / no support; 1 = strongly autonomy-supportive |
| CONTEXTUAL_COMPETENCE_CONDITIONS | competence_conditions | Interval (bipolar) | [-1; 1] | -1 = high disruption load; 0 = neutral; 1 = strong competence support |
| SOCIAL_CONNECTION_CONDITIONS | social_conditions | Interval (bipolar) | [-1; 1] | -1 = high social isolation; 0 = neutral; 1 = strong social embeddedness |
| INTRINSIC_MOTIVATION | motivation | Interval | [0; 1] | 0 = not intrinsically motivated; 1 = fully intrinsic |
| JOB_SATISFACTION | satisfaction | Interval | [-1; 1] | -1 = strongly dissatisfied; 0 = neutral; 1 = highly satisfied |
| REMOTE_WORK_CONTEXT | remote | Nominal (binary) | {0, 1} | 0 = fully on-site; 1 = remote work |
| HYBRID_WORK_CONTEXT | hybrid | Nominal (binary) | {0, 1} | 0 = not hybrid; 1 = hybrid mode |
